### how to use

Clone, build, install:

Make sure you launch it in your WM startup file (`.xinitrc`, `autostart`, whatever):
```sh
dwmblocks &
```

Custom script for battery â€” [check it here](https://github.com/eoSalinas/scripts/blob/main/dwmblocks-battery)

This script must be placed at:
```sh

# or usually:
~/.config/scripts/dwmblocks-battery
```
